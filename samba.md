Update and patch the server:

```shell
# Updating repositories and upgrading the OS:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

# The following changes below will occur inÂ `/etc/samba/smb.conf`:

Something to be conscious of, many of these configurations are duplicative among different shares- lots of rinse and repeat. Additionally, the `[global]` configuration can certainly grow in size. Keep track of your configurations and the impact they have.

1) Look for shares that are overly permissive (unauthenticated access):
```bash
[shared]
path = /srv/samba/shared
read only = no
guest ok = yes # Insecure, allows unauthenticated access (guest access)
# Notice there is no reference to file or directory permissions too.
```

Remediating overly permissive share entries, read every share and compare the details:
```bash
# This addresses unauthenticated access, authorized users, file / directory permission
[shared]
path = /srv/samba/shared
read only = no 
guest ok = no             # Disable guest access
valid users = @sambausers # Only users in the sambausers group, see `/etc/group`
create mask = 0770        # Restrict file permissions
directory mask = 0770     # Restrict directory permissions
```

Worldwide disable of guest account, mapping to guest account, and anonymous share listing:
```bash
[global]
	restrict anonymous = 2 # Restrict anonymous listing of shares 
	guest account = nobody # Prevent guest logins
	map to guest = never   # Disable mapping to guest account
```

Other options for restricting access (condition for enabling read only access):
```bash
# Write lists specifies users or groups allowed to write to the share
write list = @groupname, user1

# Read only specifies that the share is read-only for all users, not in write list
read only = yes
```

Restrict Samba share visibility (users can only see shares they have access to):
```bash
[share_name]
browseable = no

# To make share accessible only by its full name (not discoverable)
public = no
```

2) Samba Password Policy Weakness:

Ensuring strong passwords are enforced and configuring system-level password policies:
```bash
# Ensure strong passwords are enforced:
encrypt passwords = yes

# Configure system-level password policies:
[global]
	passdb backend = tdbsam
	encrypt passwords = yes
	smb passwd file = /etc/samba/smbpasswd
	obey pam restrictions = yes
```

3) Samba log file permissions and configuration for detailed logging and monitoring:

Improper permissions on Samba log files `/var/log/samba/` could allow unauthorized users to access sensitive logs or modify them:
```bash
# Adjust the file permissions for only authorized users or root:
sudo chmod 600 /var/log/samba/*
sudo chown root:root /var/log/samba/*
```

Keeping logs of Samba activity is important for identifying potential security issues, such as failed login attempts, unauthorized access attempts, or other suspicious behavior:
```bash
# To enable detailed logging
[global]
log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m # Log file for each client connection
max log size = 50                # Limit log file size to 50MB
log level = 3                    # Most detailed logging level
```

4) SMBv1 Protocol Vulnerability:

The SMBv1 protocol is outdated and contains known vulnerabilities, including the EternalBlue exdploit. Many modern systems disable SMBv1 by default, older configurations or misconfigured systems may have it enabled:
```bash
# The insecure entry to remove or comment out
smb protocl = SMB1

# The secure entry to take its place
server min protocol = SMB2
```

5) Samba Service Running as Root:

Running Samba services with root privileges (for example, by default smbd or nmbd running as root) can lead to privilege escalation attacks if an attacker gains access to Samba's underlying processes:
```bash
# Check the user under which Samba processes are running:
ps aux | grep smbd

# Ensure that Samba runs as a non-privileged, such as samba or nobody:
unix charset = UTF-8
workgroup = WORKGROUP
server string = Samba Server
hosts allow = 127.0.0.1
# Set non-root user
smb passwd file = /etc/samba/smbpasswd
```

6) Disable Null Passwords

Allowing users to authenticate with blank passwords (null passwords) is a significant risk and should be disabled:
```bash
[global]
	null passwords = no
```

7) Restricting or allowing certain IP address ranges (subnets):

You can restrict which IP addresses or subnets can access the Samba shares to prevent unauthorized access from outside your trusted network:
```bash
# This is how you create an entry to allow a specific IP range (subnet)
[global]
hosts allow = 192.168.1.0/24 # Only allow clients from 192.168.1.0/24 subnet 

# You can block specific IP addresses
[global]
hosts deny = 0.0.0.0/0 # Deny all by default
```

8) Timeout settings (protecting against DDoS / DoS attacks):

To avoid keeping connections open indefinitely and to prevent resource exhaustion in the event of a denial of service attack, setting timeout values is crucial:
```bash
[global]
	dead time = 15 # Time in minutes before idle connections are closed
	socket options = TCP_NODELAY SO_RCVBUF=8192 SO_SNDBUF=8192
	time out = 60  # Timeout for operations, useful to prevent DoS attacks
```

9) Enabling encryption (data-in-transit):

This will prevent eavesdropping and data interception:
```bash
[global]
server signing = mandatory # Enforce signing for all incoming connections
encrypt passwords = yes    # Encrypt passwords in the passwords database

# To ensure secure connections using SMBv3 encryption
[global]
smb encrypt = mandatory
```

10) Use ACLs (Access Control Lists) for fine-grained permissions:

If you need more granular access control over who can access which files in shared directories, enabling and configuring ACLs allows for advanced permissions management beyond the standard Unix permissions model:
```bash
# Install ACL tools and esnure ACLs are enabled
sudo apt-get install acl
sudo mount -o remount,acl / # Remount file system wtih ACL support

# Then set specific ACLs for Samba shares:
setfacl -m u:username:rwx /srv/samba/shared # Grant read-write-execute permissions to 'username'
```
